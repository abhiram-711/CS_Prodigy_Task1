# Simple Encryption and Decryption Program

## Overview
This project is a simple command-line encryption and decryption program implemented in Python. It uses a basic Caesar cipher technique to shift characters in the text.

## Features
- Encrypts plain text by shifting each character by a fixed number of positions in the ASCII table.
- Decrypts encrypted text by reversing the shift.
- Interactive menu for user input and choice selection.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. **Run the program:**
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

4. **Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt text.**

## Menu Options
- **Press 1** to Encrypt the plain text
- **Press 2** to Decrypt the text
- **Press 0** to Exit

## Example
- To encrypt the text "hello", enter `1`, then input `hello`.
- To decrypt the text "khoor", enter `2`, then input `khoor`.

## Dependencies
